        This class presents an interface to the sprites held in the OAM data on the Game Boy.

        The purpose is to make it easier to interpret events on the screen, in order to program a bot, or train an AI.

        Sprites are used on the Game Boy for enemy and player characters, as only sprites can have transparency, and can
        move at pixel-precision on the screen. The other method of graphics -- tile maps -- can only be placed in a
        grid-size of 8x8 pixels precision, and can have no transparency.

        Sprites on the Game Boy are tightly associated with tiles. The sprites can be seen as "upgraded" tiles, as the
        image data still refers back to one (or two) tiles. The tile that a sprite will show, can change between each
        call to `pyboy.PyBoy.tick`, so make sure to verify the `Sprite.tile_identifier` hasn't changed.

        By knowing the tile identifiers of players, enemies, power-ups and so on, you'll be able to search for them
        using `pyboy.sprite_by_tile_identifier` and feed it to your bot or AI.
