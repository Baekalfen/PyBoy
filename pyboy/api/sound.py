class Sound:
    """
    As part of the emulation, we generate a sound buffer for each frame on the screen. This class has several helper
    methods to make it possible to read this buffer out.

    When the game enables/disables the LCD, the timing will be shorter than 70224 emulated cycles. Therefore the sound
    buffer will also be shorter than 16.667ms (60 FPS).

    Because the number of samples and the timing of frames don't match exactly, you can expect a little fluctuation in
    the number of samples per frame. Normally at a sample rate of 24,000Hz, it'll be 400 samples/second. But some times,
    it might become 401. As described above, when the LCD enables/disables, it might be even less -- maybe 30, 143,
    or 200 samples. This timespan represent what the real hardware would have shown.

    If you're working with encoding the screen and sound in a video stream, you could drop these shorter frames, if they
    cause problems. They usually only happen in transitions from menu to game or similar.

        Read-only. Changing this, will not change the sample rate. See `PyBoy` constructor instead.

        The sample rate is reported per second, while the frame rate of the Game Boy is ~60 frame per second.
        So expect the sound buffer to have 1/60 of this value in the buffer after every frame. Although it will
        fluctuate. See top of the page.

        Be aware to use the `Sound.raw_buffer_head`, as not all 'frames' are of equal length.
