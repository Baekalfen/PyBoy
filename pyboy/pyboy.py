        PyBoy is loadable as an object in Python. This means, it can be initialized from another script, and be
        controlled and probed by the script. It is supported to spawn multiple emulators, just instantiate the class
        multiple times.

        A range of methods are exposed, which should allow for complete control of the emulator. Please open an issue on
        GitHub, if other methods are needed for your projects. Take a look at the files in `examples/` for a crude
        "bots", which interact with the game.

        Only the `gamerom` argument is required.

        Example:
        ```python
        >>> pyboy = PyBoy('game_rom.gb')
        >>> for _ in range(60): # Use 'while True:' for infinite
        ...     pyboy.tick()
        True...
        >>> pyboy.stop()

        ```

        Args:
            gamerom (str): Filepath to a game-ROM for Game Boy or Game Boy Color.

        Kwargs:
            * window (str): "SDL2", "OpenGL", or "null"
            * scale (int): Window scale factor. Doesn't apply to API.
            * symbols (str): Filepath to a .sym file to use. If unsure, specify `None`.
            * bootrom (str): Filepath to a boot-ROM to use. If unsure, specify `None`.
            * sound (bool): Enable sound emulation and output.
            * sound_emulated (bool): Enable sound emulation without any output. Used for compatibility.
            * cgb (bool): Forcing Game Boy Color mode.
            * color_palette (tuple): Specify the color palette to use for rendering.
            * cgb_color_palette (list of tuple): Specify the color palette to use for rendering in CGB-mode for non-color games.

        Progresses the emulator ahead by `count` frame(s).

        To run the emulator in real-time, it will need to process 60 frames a second (for example in a while-loop).
        This function will block for roughly 16,67ms per frame, to not run faster than real-time, unless you specify
        otherwise with the `PyBoy.set_emulation_speed` method.

        If you need finer control than 1 frame, have a look at `PyBoy.hook_register` to inject code at a specific point
        in the game.

        Setting `render` to `True` will make PyBoy render the screen for *the last frame* of this tick. This can be seen
        as a type of "frameskipping" optimization.

        For AI training, it's adviced to use as high a count as practical, as it will otherwise reduce performance
        substantially. While setting `render` to `False`, you can still access the `PyBoy.game_area` to get a simpler
        representation of the game.

        If `render` was enabled, use `pyboy.api.screen.Screen` to get a NumPy buffer or raw memory buffer.

class PyBoyMemoryView:
    """
    This class cannot be used directly, but is accessed through `PyBoy.memory`.

    This class serves four purposes: Reading memory (ROM/RAM), writing memory (ROM/RAM), overriding memory (ROM/RAM) and special registers.

    See the [Pan Docs: Memory Map](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/Memory_Map.html) for a great overview of the memory space.

    Memory can be accessed as individual bytes (`pyboy.memory[0x00]`) or as slices (`pyboy.memory[0x00:0x10]`). And if
    applicable, a specific ROM/RAM bank can be defined before the address (`pyboy.memory[0, 0x00]` or `pyboy.memory[0, 0x00:0x10]`).

    The boot ROM is accessed using the special "-1" ROM bank.

    The find addresses of interest, either search online for something like: "[game title] RAM map", or find them yourself
    using `PyBoy.memory_scanner`.

    **Read:**

    If you're developing a bot or AI with this API, you're most likely going to be using read the most. This is how you
    would efficiently read the score, time, coins, positions etc. in a game's memory.

    ```python
    >>> pyboy.memory[0x0000] # Read one byte at address 0x0000
    49
    >>> pyboy.memory[0x0000:0x0010] # Read 16 bytes from 0x0000 to 0x0010 (excluding 0x0010)
    [49, 254, 255, 33, 0, 128, 175, 34, 124, 254, 160, 32, 249, 6, 48, 33]
    >>> pyboy.memory[-1, 0x0000:0x0010] # Read 16 bytes from 0x0000 to 0x0010 (excluding 0x0010) from the boot ROM
    [49, 254, 255, 33, 0, 128, 175, 34, 124, 254, 160, 32, 249, 6, 48, 33]
    >>> pyboy.memory[0, 0x0000:0x0010] # Read 16 bytes from 0x0000 to 0x0010 (excluding 0x0010) from ROM bank 0
    [64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 65, 65, 65, 71, 65, 65, 65, 72, 73]
    >>> pyboy.memory[2, 0xA000] # Read from external RAM on cartridge (if any) from bank 2 at address 0xA000
    0
    ```

    **Write:**

    Writing to Game Boy memory can be complicated because of the limited address space. There's a lot of memory that
    isn't directly accessible, and can be hidden through "memory banking". This means that the same address range
    (for example 0x4000 to 0x8000) can change depending on what state the game is in.

    If you want to change an address in the ROM, then look at override below. Issuing writes to the ROM area actually
    sends commands to the [Memory Bank Controller (MBC)](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/MBCs.html#mbcs) on the cartridge.

    A write is done by assigning to the `PyBoy.memory` object. It's recommended to define the bank to avoid mistakes
    (`pyboy.memory[2, 0xA000]=1`). Without defining the bank, PyBoy will pick the current bank for the given address if
    needed (`pyboy.memory[0xA000]=1`).

    At this point, all reads will return a new list of the values in the given range. The slices will not reference back to the PyBoy memory. This feature might come in the future.

    ```python
    >>> pyboy.memory[0xC000] = 123 # Write to WRAM at address 0xC000
    >>> pyboy.memory[0xC000:0xC00A] = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] # Write to WRAM from address 0xC000 to 0xC00A
    >>> pyboy.memory[0xC010:0xC01A] = 0 # Write to WRAM from address 0xC010 to 0xC01A
    >>> pyboy.memory[0x1000] = 123 # Not writing 123 at address 0x1000! This sends a command to the cartridge's MBC.
    >>> pyboy.memory[2, 0xA000] = 123 # Write to external RAM on cartridge (if any) for bank 2 at address 0xA000
    >>> # Game Boy Color (CGB) only:
    >>> pyboy_cgb.memory[1, 0x8000] = 25 # Write to VRAM bank 1 at address 0xD000 when in CGB mode
    >>> pyboy_cgb.memory[6, 0xD000] = 25 # Write to WRAM bank 6 at address 0xD000 when in CGB mode
    ```

    **Override:**

    Override data at a given memory address of the Game Boy's ROM.

    This can be used to reprogram a game ROM to change its behavior.

    This will not let your override RAM or a special register. This will let you override data in the ROM at any given bank.
    This is the memory allocated at 0x0000 to 0x8000, where 0x4000 to 0x8000 can be changed from the MBC.

    _NOTE_: Any changes here are not saved or loaded to game states! Use this function with caution and reapply
    any overrides when reloading the ROM.

    To override, it's required to provide the ROM-bank you're changing. Otherwise, it'll be considered a regular 'write' as described above.

    ```python
    >>> pyboy.memory[0, 0x0010] = 10 # Override ROM-bank 0 at address 0x0010
    >>> pyboy.memory[0, 0x0010:0x001A] = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] # Override ROM-bank 0 at address 0x0010 to 0x001A
    >>> pyboy.memory[-1, 0x0010] = 10 # Override boot ROM at address 0x0010
    >>> pyboy.memory[1, 0x6000] = 12 # Override ROM-bank 1 at address 0x6000
    >>> pyboy.memory[0x1000] = 12 # This will not override, as there is no ROM bank assigned!
    ```

    **Special Registers:**

    The Game Boy has a range of memory addresses known as [hardware registers](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/Hardware_Reg_List.html). These control parts of the hardware like LCD,
    Timer, DMA, serial and so on. Even though they might appear as regular RAM addresses, reading/writing these addresses
    often results in special side-effects.

    The [DIV (0xFF04) register](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/Timer_and_Divider_Registers.html#ff04--div-divider-register) for example provides a number that increments 16 thousand times each second. This can be
    used as a source of randomness in games. If you read the value, you'll get a pseudo-random number. But if you write
    *any* value to the register, it'll reset to zero.

    ```python
    >>> pyboy.memory[0xFF04] # DIV register
    163
    >>> pyboy.memory[0xFF04] = 123 # Trying to write to it will always reset it to zero
    >>> pyboy.memory[0xFF04]
    0
    ```
