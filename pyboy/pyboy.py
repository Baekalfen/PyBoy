        PyBoy is loadable as an object in Python. This means, it can be initialized from another script, and be
        controlled and probed by the script. It is supported to spawn multiple emulators, just instantiate the class
        multiple times.

        This object, `pyboy.WindowEvent`, and the `pyboy.botsupport` module, are the only official user-facing
        interfaces. All other parts of the emulator, are subject to change.

        A range of methods are exposed, which should allow for complete control of the emulator. Please open an issue on
        GitHub, if other methods are needed for your projects. Take a look at `interface_example.py` or `tetris_bot.py`
        for a crude "bot", which interacts with the game.

        Only the `gamerom_file` argument is required.

        Args:
            gamerom_file (str): Filepath to a game-ROM for Game Boy or Game Boy Color.

        Kwargs:
            bootrom_file (str): Filepath to a boot-ROM to use. If unsure, specify `None`.
            profiling (bool): Profile the emulator and report opcode usage (internal use).
            disable_renderer (bool): Can be used to optimize performance, by internally disable rendering of the screen.
            color_palette (tuple): Specify the color palette to use for rendering.

        Other keyword arguments may exist for plugins that are not listed here. They can be viewed with the
        `parser_arguments()` method in the pyboy.plugins.manager module, or by running pyboy --help in the terminal.
