This project uses a portion of the bold 16 pixel height Terminus font,
stored here as a compressed set of 16 byte hex strings for the 256
glyphs in the IBM-437 codepage.

The Terminus font is released under the Open Font License, which can
be found in this directory.

The full source code for the Terminus font is available at
