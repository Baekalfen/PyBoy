# Using PyBoy with Gymnasium

As most people opted to modify the OpenAI Gym that PyBoy used to have, we've decided to remove the Gym Env from the codebase itself and replace it with this example. To use it, copy it into your codebase, and modify it to your needs.

To install the requirements, run: `pip install pyboy numpy gymnasium`.

Thanks to [Nicole Faye](https://github.com/NicoleFaye/) for providing the basis for this sample code. If you have questions or improvements to the code, come and tell us on Discord.
