# PyBoy

It is highly recommended to read the [report](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/raw/master/PyBoy.pdf) to get a light introduction to Game Boy emulation. The report is relevant, eventhough you want to contribute to another emulator, or create your own.

If you've read the report and want more explicit details, have a look at the [Pan Docs](http://bgb.bircd.org/pandocs.htm).


**To get more information about the project, and find out how to [get started](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation), have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki).**
