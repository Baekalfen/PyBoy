# PyBoy - Now in CPython!

__If you have any questions, or just want to chat, [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/Zrf2nyH).__


It is highly recommended to read the [report](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/raw/master/PyBoy.pdf) to get a light introduction to Game Boy emulation. The report is relevant, eventhough you want to contribute to another emulator, or create your own.

If you've read the report and want more explicit details, have a look at the [Pan Docs](http://bgb.bircd.org/pandocs.htm).

Installation
============
We have now moved away from PyPy, and PyBoy fully supports regular CPython, by the use of Cython. Performance has also increased dramatically.

The code base is still pure Python, which means it will still run in CPython and PyPy (although slowly). Cython is an addition, where we can compile the code to run 100-200 times faster.

**To get started, look at the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation).** We support: macOS, Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) and Linux (Ubuntu).

At the Wiki page, you will also find out how to interface with PyBoy from your own project: [Wiki](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki).



# OpenAI Interface

```python
import sys
from Source.pyboy import PyBoy
from Source.pyboy.logger import addconsolehandler
from Source.openai_env import make_env

addconsolehandler()

def main(env_name):
    pyboy = PyBoy(sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else None, env_name)
    env = make_env(env=pyboy)
    for _ in range(5000):
        observation, reward, done, info = env.step(9)# temp random action
    env.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    env_name = "ROMs/POKEMON BLUE.gb"
    main(env_name=env_name)
```

Contribute
==========
Any contribution is appreciated. The currently known errors are registered in the Issues tab. Feel free to take a swing at any one of them.

For the more major features, there are six that you can give a try. They are also described in more detail in the [project list](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/raw/master/Projects/Projects.pdf):
* Sound
* Color
* Link Cable
* _(Experimental)_ Time travel - rewind time in the emulator
* _(Experimental)_ AI - use the `botsupport` to train a neural network
* Unit tests and/or test ROM

If you want to implement something which is not on the list, feel free to do so anyway. If you want to merge it into our repo, then just send a pull request and we will have a look at it.
